# hello-world
First repository project

This is the beging of my fanatical Linux journey.

I will begin with keeping small scripts and one liners here for future refrence.

I am currently in the last week of traning for the TNT program.

Doug ball is my current instructor and is an increadably cool guy!!


Well, that is all for now - have a great day!
